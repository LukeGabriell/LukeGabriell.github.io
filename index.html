    <h2>Welcome to my portfolio</h2>
    <p>My name is Luukas i am 21 years old future programmer from Helsinki.
        <br>
        My hobbies are gaming and basketball. I graduated 2020 from vocational college as a welder and metalworker
        but unfortunately i broke my shoulder and i couldn't keep my job anymore. Im so glad i decided to try this
        web programming path because im totally obsessed and i really hope i can do this as my job one day.
